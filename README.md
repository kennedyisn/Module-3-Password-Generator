# Module-3-Password-Generator

## Description
  
In today's world it is very important to protect private information by using different passwords that arent easily detectable like the run of the mill prior addresses, pet names, and sports team names. One way we can do that is by randomly generating passwords that have no relation to ourselves. This application serves that problem by randomly generating a password based on specifications made by the user. By making this project I get to work on my skills as a programmer, while creating a useful tool that I could use in my proffesional work after this course as client privacy is crucial. In the process of making this project I learned that Java is so heavily used in the industry because of its ability to dynamically interact with a user, but it is easy to have an element or function out of place resulting in code that isnt properly working. So it is important to properly document your code and I found it helpful to segment it so that I can pinpoint where a problem arises.
